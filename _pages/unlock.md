# Unlock Orgro

Orgro for iOS is offered as a “try before you buy”-style free app. If you want
to continue using Orgro after the free trial period, please purchase a license
from the Settings screen.

Purchasing Orgro is a one-time (non-subscription), lifetime unlock for all
current features.

## What about future features?

I can’t make promises about the future, but I do not plan to charge for
additional features *unless they rely on a backend server or other component
that incurs ongoing costs to run and maintain*. No such features are currently
planned.

## I bought the app when it wasn’t free; what about me?

Thank you for being an early supporter of Orgro. You should have been
automatically granted a full unlock; you can confirm this on the Settings
screen.

If the Settings screen does not show Orgro as unlocked,

1. Try restoring purchases
2. If that doesn't work, please [contact support](mailto:support@orgro.org)

## What happens to my data if I don’t want to purchase?

Orgro does not “contain” any of your Org documents; they are all stored
somewhere on your device or in another app such as Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
that handles the actual storage. If you choose not to unlock Orgro, your data
will still be right where you left it, accessible through the storing app or
your device’s file browser.
